		<p>My name is Ilan Cheraki, I am 16 years old and I live in Bologna, Italy. I was born in the Parisien suburbs in France, and five years ago I moved to California, in the United States of America. This year, my family and I moved to Bologna, Italy because of my dad’s job. I speak English (as a second language), French (as a mother tongue), and I am currently trying to learn Spanish and Italian. My passions are: playing water polo, figure painting, reading (non-fiction history and science-fiction) listening to music (heavy metal, rock and roll), playing drums (mostly jazz and rock), driving motorcycles, and hiking. Academically, I cannot stop studying history, and lately I have been 
		particularly interested in Economics. </p>

INTERVIEW TO MYSELF:
<ol>
<li> <strong>What am I interested in?</strong> There are three things I am most interested in. The first one would be studying history. I have always been eager to learn about the past, and how we came to know the world as it currently is. It helps me better understand people’s cultural backgrounds and understand the past of countries around the world. The second topic I am most interested in is technology. I’ve always been fascinated by humans’ capacity to progress and innovate, and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for us. The last thing I am interested in is knowledge. I want to know how everything came to be, how everything works, and how everything will change. </li>

<li> <strong>About what issues do I feel most passionate? </strong>I feel most passionate about the environmental problems the world is currently experiencing. Global Warming has been a worldwide issue in the last few years and governments have been trying to find a solution to it. I think that reaching out to more people and raising awareness is the best way to control this phenomenon. Seeing how well people are aware of the environment where I used to live in California, I hope to be able to spread this knowledge here, in Italy.</li>

<li> <strong>What are my talents?</strong> I believe myself to be a strong speaker, able to communicate my ideas with confidence. Through the years spent studying different subjects, I have been able to develop a photographic memory, which allows me to quickly remember information.</li>

<li> <strong>What skill/talent would I like to improve?</strong> I would like to improve my organization skills. I want to be able to organize my schedule in a balanced way, allowing me to better spent my time. I would also like to improve my time managing skills. I have always had a hard time working on homework efficiently, without spending too much time on each subject, which would allow me to sleep more since I already have a very busy schedule.</li>

<li> <strong>What am I already doing that could be part of my CAS programme?</strong> I am currently enrolled in the local water polo team, which is a challenge for me because there is a language barrier between me and my team, since I do not speak italian, and they barely speak english. I am currently trying to find a drum teacher and I also hope to be able to join a band. Lastly I am trying to learn italian in order to better communicate with my peers and people around the city.</li>

<li> <strong>What would I like to be involved in? </strong>I would like to be involved in an environmental organization, possibly teach english or French, or maybe start my own project to help the people of my community.</li>

<li> <strong>Are there any local clubs or community associations in which I could be involved?</strong> I am relatively new to this town, and I haven’t gotten the chance to learn about local clubs and community associations.</li>

<li> <strong>What would I like to learn more about?</strong> I would like to learn about different ways I could start my own community project, raise money towards it and get people involved. It would be a great achievement for myself to be able to create something on my own, which is directed towards helping others and the community.</li>

<li> <strong>What have I always wanted to try but haven’t yet?</strong> I have always wanted to try rowing for the first time, because I’ve always thought it to be a challenging sport that requires a team effort. I have also been thinking about creating my own stock market portfolio, since it’s a topic I am very interested in.</li>

<li> <strong>What other questions may help?</strong> Write down two and answer them.</li>
